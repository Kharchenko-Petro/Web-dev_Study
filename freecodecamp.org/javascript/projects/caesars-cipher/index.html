    <h2><center>Caesars Cipher</center></h2>
    <p>One of the simplest and most widely known <i>ciphers</i> is a <i>Caesar cipher</i>, 
        also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of 
        the letters are shifted by some set amount.</p>

    <p>A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where 
        the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. 
        Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.</p>
        
    <p>Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input 
        and returns a decoded string.</p>
        
    <p>All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic 
        character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.</p>
